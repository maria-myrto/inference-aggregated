The Figures and Tables in the paper can be reproduced using the following scripts:

Main body

Table I: OU_results.py, uses the results from dataset 10.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2 
*If you want to run the actual experiment run ou_likelihood.py

FIG 1: ou_stat_var_plots.py

Table II, FIG 2: LV_results.py
*If you want to run the actual experiment run LV_inference.py

FIG 3: LV_KF1.py, LV_KF2.py

Table III: Transl_inh_results.py
*If you want to run the actual experiment run Transl_inh_inference.py

Table IV: luci_results.py (we have reported the results from the third chain)
change to c_all = c_all1 for getting KF1 results and c_all = c_all2 for KF2

FIG 4: luci_results.py

Appendix

FIG 13, 22: : OU_results.py, uses the results from dataset 10.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2 

Table V: OU_results.py, uses the top averaged results.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2 

FIG 23: LV_results.py

FIG 24: LV_KF1.py, LV_KF2.py

FIG 30: Transl_inh_results.py

FIG 36, 42: luci_results.py (we have reported the results from the third chain)
change to c_all = c_all1 for getting KF1 results and c_all = c_all2 for KF2
