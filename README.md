The Figures and Tables in the paper can be reproduced using the following scripts:

Table 1: OU_results.py, uses the results from dataset 10.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2 
*If you want to run the actual experiment run ou_likelihood.py

FIG 1: ou_stat_var_plots.py

Table 2, FIG 2: LV_results.py
*If you want to run the actual experiment run LV_inference.py

FIG 3: LV_KF1.py, LV_KF2.py

Table 3: Transl_inh_results.py
*If you want to run the actual experiment run Transl_inh_inference.py

Table 4: luci_results.py (we have reported the results from the third chain)
change to c_all = c_all1 for getting KF1 results and c_all = c_all2 for KF2

FIG 4: luci_results.py

Table 5: OU_results.py, uses the top averaged results.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2 

Table 6: LV_NM.py

FIG 5: ouVSintegratedVSaggregated.py

FIG 6, 7: : OU_results.py, uses the results from dataset 10.
To get the results for all steps change the .bin file names to  step01, step05, step1, step2
